# Dan's Introduction

This challenge was fairly straightforward, however the challenge lied in _optimization_. It was yet another "try all possibilities and report back on which is the most effective" challenge, but the trick here was deciding exactly what parts of the forking we can do without and would be considered redundant. I didn't feel all that great afterwards for how long my way took (probably from the whole over-engineering part) as I clocked my part 2 solve at `42m 41s`, but at least it was better than it could've been.

## Part 1

You're given a blueprint and just need to check how to efficiently churn out as many geodes as possible. I created objects on top of objects to facilitate this, where a Blueprint was a struct object that contained the robots' cost to create. Doing it this way I was able to create some simple functions to handle the basic math such as the handling of resources when using it towards building another robot. However it wound up causing me to refer to specific states using something like `curr_state.bp.Ore.worth.ore` to refer to the cost of Ore it takes to build an Ore-mining robot. Nevertheless, my reasoning was to use a Depth-First-Search pathfinding algorithm, where the "forks" to test were:

- Build an Ore Robot
- Build a Clay Robot
- Build an Obsidian Robot
- Build a Geode Robot
- Do Nothing

Specifically, I referred to this as the `BUILD or BAKE` decision. I can always just do nothing and mine whatever ore/clay/obsidian/geodes as necessary (`BAKE`), but if I wanted to build one I'd have to decide what I actually _can_ build. At the beginning, I started with "if I have enough resources to build a robot, slap the build plan into the stack and move on." That proved to be a ridiculous attempt because of the sheer amount of exponential forking involved here.

## Optimization Level 1

I took the advice of several others who have done this challenge before and started working on "unnecessary forks" in the process. Since I'm only able to build one robot per turn, I'd have to be effective at choosing _what_ robot to build. To that end, the first thing to consider is how much of any type of robot is needed. Considering I'm only able to build one robot per minute, logic dictates that if I build more than the _maximum_ cost of that particular ore-robot that it would be a waste of a turn. So the first optimization necessary was to determine the maximum amount of ore needed to build any of the robots, and don't fork out a series where that number is exceeded. For example, take the first example blueprint:

```
Blueprint 1:
  Each ore robot costs 4 ore.
  Each clay robot costs 2 ore.
  Each obsidian robot costs 3 ore and 14 clay.
  Each geode robot costs 2 ore and 7 obsidian.
```

In this case, the highest Ore cost here is 4. That means that if I build any more than 4 Ore-mining robots it would be a waste because at the very least I could have built a clay mining robot, or even an obsidian robot if I had enough clay. This cut down considerably on the amount of forking.

## Optimization level 2

At this point, I figured that if I even had the potential to create a geode robot, then that would be the _most_ efficient fork regardless. If I could create a geode robot on this turn, stick THAT decision onto the stack ONLY. No need to build anything else even if I could.

## Optimization Level 3

This was a little bit more esoteric. I decided that building any robot on the last step was pointless because it couldn't mine anything more. I used this to cut down on the forking quite a bit. At this point I was able to run through the blueprints for Part 1 in about 5 minutes or so. Not as good as others, but at this point I was just happy it was done.

## Part 2

This got even more intense. Basically instead of 24 minutes, find out how many geodes you can crack in 32 minutes. It was only 8 minutes longer but this became exponentially larger. At this point I needed even more optimizations. I came across one more that I have to give credit to [Nicky Meuleman](https://nickymeuleman.netlify.app/garden/aoc2022-day19) for, it cut down my processing time _considerably_.

## Optimization Level 4

The gist is: at each fork, find out how many _theoretical_ geodes I can make regardless of how many resources I have. Say that I had an infinite amount of clay and ore, and still had 10 minutes left to work. First, find out how many geodes I can make if I just mined for the remaining time and didn't build any:

```
total_potential = (current_amt_of_geode_robots * minutes_left) + current_amt_of_geodes
```

Now, let's say I can make a new geode robot every turn until the time runs out. How many geodes can I make? The formula for that is:

```go
geodes := 0
for i := 0; i < minutes_left; i++ {
    geodes += i
}
```

For every new robot that is built, it can't mine anything the first minute it was decided to be built, so that accounts for it being 0 on the first minute. But every minute after that the amount of geodes it mines is increased by 1. So take the output of the above `geode` variable and add it to the `total_potential` variable, and you have the total amount of potential geodes that can be processed at that minute under _perfect_ circumstances. Take this number and compare it to the highest potential geodes outcome we've come across so far. If the output of the above is greater than the currently lower than the highest amount of geodes mined so far, then throw out that branch. There is no need to run it.

Doing the above optimized my code enough that it wasn't _terrible_, but still I'm sure I could have made this better. But I've learned something about coding in general: The Sunk Cost Fallacy is a **big freakin deal**. Sometimes you are so invested in the amount of time and effort you put towards the code you've written that you'll bolt on any ol' back-peddling code just to get it to work proper. But sometimes the best thing to do is just go back and start some things over. Oh well, I'll leave you with my garbage code anyway. What is success without failure upon failure upon failure?

**EDIT:** I have made a terrible mistake. Originally for the "Level 4 Optimization" as stated above, I had it looking for `theoretical_potential_geodes >= max_known_geodes`, when I _should have_ used `theoretical_potential_geodes > max_known_geodes`. That simple tweak shaved enough time down to complete Part 2 in `23m and 58s`!

## What I Learned

I did manage to use an anonymous function here. That was neat. (For the theoretical geodes total, see [State.go](State.go).)

# --- Day 19: Not Enough Minerals ---

Your scans show that the lava did indeed form obsidian!

The wind has changed direction enough to stop sending lava droplets toward you, so you and the elephants exit the cave. As you do, you notice a collection of geodes around the pond. Perhaps you could use the obsidian to create some geode-cracking robots and break them open?

To collect the obsidian from the bottom of the pond, you'll need waterproof obsidian-collecting robots. Fortunately, there is an abundant amount of clay nearby that you can use to make them waterproof.

In order to harvest the clay, you'll need special-purpose clay-collecting robots. To make any type of robot, you'll need ore, which is also plentiful but in the opposite direction from the clay.

Collecting ore requires ore-collecting robots with big drills. Fortunately, you have exactly one ore-collecting robot in your pack that you can use to kickstart the whole operation.

Each robot can collect 1 of its resource type per minute. It also takes one minute for the robot factory (also conveniently from your pack) to construct any type of robot, although it consumes the necessary resources available when construction begins.

The robot factory has many blueprints (your puzzle input) you can choose from, but once you've configured it with a blueprint, you can't change it. You'll need to work out which blueprint is best.

For example:

```
Blueprint 1:
  Each ore robot costs 4 ore.
  Each clay robot costs 2 ore.
  Each obsidian robot costs 3 ore and 14 clay.
  Each geode robot costs 2 ore and 7 obsidian.

Blueprint 2:
  Each ore robot costs 2 ore.
  Each clay robot costs 3 ore.
  Each obsidian robot costs 3 ore and 8 clay.
  Each geode robot costs 3 ore and 12 obsidian.
```

(Blueprints have been line-wrapped here for legibility. The robot factory's actual assortment of blueprints are provided one blueprint per line.)

The elephants are starting to look hungry, so you shouldn't take too long; you need to figure out which blueprint would maximize the number of opened geodes after 24 minutes by figuring out which robots to build and when to build them.

Using blueprint 1 in the example above, the largest number of geodes you could open in 24 minutes is 9. One way to achieve that is:

```

However, by using blueprint 2 in the example above, you could do even better: the largest number of geodes you could open in 24 minutes is 12.

Determine the quality level of each blueprint by multiplying that blueprint's ID number with the largest number of geodes that can be opened in 24 minutes using that blueprint. In this example, the first blueprint has ID 1 and can open 9 geodes, so its quality level is 9. The second blueprint has ID 2 and can open 12 geodes, so its quality level is 24. Finally, if you add up the quality levels of all of the blueprints in the list, you get 33.

Determine the quality level of each blueprint using the largest number of geodes it could produce in 24 minutes. What do you get if you add up the quality level of all of the blueprints in your list?

Your puzzle answer was `1480`.

# --- Part Two ---

While you were choosing the best blueprint, the elephants found some food on their own, so you're not in as much of a hurry; you figure you probably have 32 minutes before the wind changes direction again and you'll need to get out of range of the erupting volcano.

Unfortunately, one of the elephants ate most of your blueprint list! Now, only the first three blueprints in your list are intact.

In 32 minutes, the largest number of geodes blueprint 1 (from the example above) can open is 56. One way to achieve that is:

However, blueprint 2 from the example above is still better; using it, the largest number of geodes you could open in 32 minutes is 62.

You no longer have enough blueprints to worry about quality levels. Instead, for each of the first three blueprints, determine the largest number of geodes you could open; then, multiply these three values together.

Don't worry about quality levels; instead, just determine the largest number of geodes you could open using each of the first three blueprints. What do you get if you multiply these numbers together?
