# Advent of Code 2022

This is my attempt at completing the Advent of Code for 2022. I don't normally do this and frankly I'm not doing this for any speed challenge or anything (especially since I'm still doing this well into January and even longer). I began by doing this in Python, a language I am very familiar with, and decided I might as well try to force myself to do this in Go. It's a language that I'm trying to learn more about and frankly I'm loving it. It's a simpler language that is extremely fast and powerful. I do enjoy it a lot. That said, I'm hoping that after the AOC I will be significantly more adept at Go and can use it for personal projects. Looking forward to it!

For now though, I will use this as a "Table of Contents" of sort to link to specific things I learned so that I can quickly reference them later.
