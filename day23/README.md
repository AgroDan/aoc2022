# Dan's Introduction

This was a frustrating one. There are so. many. decisions. to. make. If this happens, then do this. Unless this happens, in which case do this. Then after the first full moon on sunday after the bell rings, make sure the Elves do this. It was rough.

I suppose what was so difficult about it was that the _example_ data worked out, but the _challenge_ data did not. When you have so many moving parts with this entire challenge, debugging becomes nigh impossible. I did my best.

It was so rough in fact that I just wiped the slate clean and started over. The first iteration (under the `./broken/` directory) was extremely over-engineered. Over-engineered and difficult to keep up with. I approached the challenge as if I was drawing a map that was constantly growing. With each growth of the map, all of the Elves' coordinates were incremented to reflect the change. Once I got that working, I found out how to _shrink_ the map, which ultimately helped me draw a rectangle around the elves. This turned out to be bad, as I consistently got bad results out of it. Like I said, it worked fine for the example data, but when I worked with the challenge data I was off considerably. I had no way of finding out exactly what went wrong here, so I scrapped the whole idea and started over.

## Part One

The first part of the challenge I approached a bit differently. This time I didn't draw a map, but instead I just worked with relative coordinates. It would parse the map and give every single elf what I referred to as a _coordinate string_, which was represented as `X~Y`. I then wrote a function which parsed the string into two separate integers. There may be a better way to handle that (in fact I'm almost sure of it), but this was how I was working conceptually, and once I get to the point of working this properly I didn't want to waste time going back and re-architecting my code to use something a bit more appropriate, like mapping a struct coordinate, which in hindsight would probably have worked quite a bit better. Oh well, it worked and that's what matters.

Ultimately, I created a finite set to specify the elves, then worked with a `GetDirection()` function which, given a direction in the form of a string like `N`, `SW`, etc, would return a delta of the position to check. For example, if I wanted to check north, I would add -1 to Y, and add 0 to X. Using that I was able to create a finite set for proposals, which I then used to determine if more than one proposal was declared. From there I just acted out the protocols for all the elves and after some minor tweaking I managed to get it to work properly with the example data. When I ran it against the challenge data, it worked perfectly and spit out the right answer. Finally.

## Part Two

Part two was incredibly simple. Basically just find out how many iterations it would take for all the elves to stop moving. I stopped it from printing out a map and this time just told it to keep iterating until _no more proposals were declared._ Once it did that, just break and return the iteration count. This was one of the easiest part 2's I've ever done. I think I got it just 2 minutes after finding part 1.

## What I Learned

I learned a bit more about maps and how to use them. And hindsight being 20/20, I shouldn't use a `map[string]struct{}` where the string is something like `-1~5`, when I can properly declare a Coord struct:

```go
type Coord struct {
    Row,Col int
}
```

Then declare a better map:

```go
var ElfSet = make(map[Coord]struct{})
```

...that might have made my code cleaner and easier to work with. But by the time I realized that I had zoned out on my `Row~Col` mapping and it was long into the dev process. I realize how dumb that was but it's too late now. Enjoy my garbage code. But again, hey I'm learning!

# --- Day 23: Unstable Diffusion ---

You enter a large crater of gray dirt where the grove is supposed to be. All around you, plants you imagine were expected to be full of fruit are instead withered and broken. A large group of Elves has formed in the middle of the grove.

"...but this volcano has been dormant for months. Without ash, the fruit can't grow!"

You look up to see a massive, snow-capped mountain towering above you.

"It's not like there are other active volcanoes here; we've looked everywhere."

"But our scanners show active magma flows; clearly it's going somewhere."

They finally notice you at the edge of the grove, your pack almost overflowing from the random star fruit you've been collecting. Behind you, elephants and monkeys explore the grove, looking concerned. Then, the Elves recognize the ash cloud slowly spreading above your recent detour.

"Why do you--" "How is--" "Did you just--"

Before any of them can form a complete question, another Elf speaks up: "Okay, new plan. We have almost enough fruit already, and ash from the plume should spread here eventually. If we quickly plant new seedlings now, we can still make it to the extraction point. Spread out!"

The Elves each reach into their pack and pull out a tiny plant. The plants rely on important nutrients from the ash, so they can't be planted too close together.

There isn't enough time to let the Elves figure out where to plant the seedlings themselves; you quickly scan the grove (your puzzle input) and note their positions.

For example:

```
....#..
..###.#
#...#.#
.#...##
#.###..
##.#.##
.#..#..
```

The scan shows Elves # and empty ground .; outside your scan, more empty ground extends a long way in every direction. The scan is oriented so that north is up; orthogonal directions are written N (north), S (south), W (west), and E (east), while diagonal directions are written NE, NW, SE, SW.

The Elves follow a time-consuming process to figure out where they should each go; you can speed up this process considerably. The process consists of some number of rounds during which Elves alternate between considering where to move and actually moving.

During the first half of each round, each Elf considers the eight positions adjacent to themself. If no other Elves are in one of those eight positions, the Elf does not do anything during this round. Otherwise, the Elf looks in each of four directions in the following order and proposes moving one step in the first valid direction:

    If there is no Elf in the N, NE, or NW adjacent positions, the Elf proposes moving north one step.
    If there is no Elf in the S, SE, or SW adjacent positions, the Elf proposes moving south one step.
    If there is no Elf in the W, NW, or SW adjacent positions, the Elf proposes moving west one step.
    If there is no Elf in the E, NE, or SE adjacent positions, the Elf proposes moving east one step.

After each Elf has had a chance to propose a move, the second half of the round can begin. Simultaneously, each Elf moves to their proposed destination tile if they were the only Elf to propose moving to that position. If two or more Elves propose moving to the same position, none of those Elves move.

Finally, at the end of the round, the first direction the Elves considered is moved to the end of the list of directions. For example, during the second round, the Elves would try proposing a move to the south first, then west, then east, then north. On the third round, the Elves would first consider west, then east, then north, then south.

As a smaller example, consider just these five Elves:

```
.....
..##.
..#..
.....
..##.
.....
```

The northernmost two Elves and southernmost two Elves all propose moving north, while the middle Elf cannot move north and proposes moving south. The middle Elf proposes the same destination as the southwest Elf, so neither of them move, but the other three do:

```
..##.
.....
..#..
...#.
..#..
.....
```

Next, the northernmost two Elves and the southernmost Elf all propose moving south. Of the remaining middle two Elves, the west one cannot move south and proposes moving west, while the east one cannot move south or west and proposes moving east. All five Elves succeed in moving to their proposed positions:

```
.....
..##.
.#...
....#
.....
..#..
```

Finally, the southernmost two Elves choose not to move at all. Of the remaining three Elves, the west one proposes moving west, the east one proposes moving east, and the middle one proposes moving north; all three succeed in moving:

```
..#..
....#
#....
....#
.....
..#..
```

At this point, no Elves need to move, and so the process ends.

The larger example above proceeds as follows:

```

To make sure they're on the right track, the Elves like to check after round 10 that they're making good progress toward covering enough ground. To do this, count the number of empty ground tiles contained by the smallest rectangle that contains every Elf. (The edges of the rectangle should be aligned to the N/S/E/W directions; the Elves do not have the patience to calculate arbitrary rectangles.) In the above example, that rectangle is:

```
......#.....
..........#.
.#.#..#.....
.....#......
..#.....#..#
#......##...
....##......
.#........#.
...#.#..#...
............
...#..#..#..
```

In this region, the number of empty ground tiles is 110.

Simulate the Elves' process and find the smallest rectangle that contains the Elves after 10 rounds. How many empty ground tiles does that rectangle contain?

Your puzzle answer was `3925`.

# --- Part Two ---

It seems you're on the right track. Finish simulating the process and figure out where the Elves need to go. How many rounds did you save them?

In the example above, the first round where no Elf moved was round 20:

```
.......#......
....#......#..
..#.....#.....
......#.......
...#....#.#..#
#.............
....#.....#...
..#.....#.....
....#.#....#..
.........#....
....#......#..
.......#......
```

Figure out where the Elves need to go. What is the number of the first round where no Elf moves?

Your puzzle answer was `903`.
